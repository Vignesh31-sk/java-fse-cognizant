# Scenario 3: Loan Due Reminder System

## Overview
This PL/SQL block creates an automated loan reminder system that identifies loans due within the next 30 days and generates personalized reminder messages for each customer. The system categorizes reminders by urgency and provides comprehensive reporting.

## Database Schema and Sample Data
**All required table structures and sample data are included in the SQL file for immediate execution.**

The code creates and populates the following tables:

### LOANS Table
- `loan_id` (Primary Key)
- `customer_id` (Foreign Key)
- `loan_amount` (NUMBER)
- `remaining_balance` (NUMBER)
- `monthly_payment` (NUMBER)
- `due_date` (DATE)
- `loan_type` (VARCHAR2)
- `loan_status` (VARCHAR2)

### CUSTOMERS Table
- `customer_id` (Primary Key)
- `customer_name` (VARCHAR2)
- `email` (VARCHAR2)
- `phone` (VARCHAR2)

### LOAN_REMINDERS Table (Optional - for audit trail)
- `reminder_id` (Primary Key)
- `loan_id` (Foreign Key)
- `customer_id` (Foreign Key)
- `reminder_date` (DATE)
- `due_date` (DATE)
- `urgency_level` (VARCHAR2)
- `message_sent` (VARCHAR2)
- `created_date` (DATE)

## Code Explanation

### 1. Advanced Cursor with Date Filtering
```sql
CURSOR c_due_loans IS
    SELECT l.loan_id, l.customer_id, l.loan_amount, l.due_date, 
           l.remaining_balance, l.monthly_payment, l.loan_type,
           c.customer_name, c.email, c.phone,
           (l.due_date - SYSDATE) as days_until_due
    FROM loans l
    INNER JOIN customers c ON l.customer_id = c.customer_id
    WHERE l.loan_status = 'ACTIVE'
    AND l.due_date BETWEEN SYSDATE AND (SYSDATE + 30)
    ORDER BY l.due_date ASC, c.customer_name;
```
- Calculates `days_until_due` in the cursor for efficiency
- Filters for loans due within 30 days
- Orders by due date (most urgent first)
- Includes customer contact information

### 2. Urgency Classification Logic
```sql
IF v_days_until_due <= 7 THEN
    v_urgency_level := 'URGENT';
    v_urgent_reminders := v_urgent_reminders + 1;
ELSE
    v_urgency_level := 'STANDARD';
    v_standard_reminders := v_standard_reminders + 1;
END IF;
```
- **URGENT**: Loans due within 7 days
- **STANDARD**: Loans due within 8-30 days
- Separate counters track each category

### 3. Dynamic Message Generation
```sql
v_reminder_message := 'Dear ' || rec.customer_name || ', ' ||
                     'your ' || rec.loan_type || ' loan (ID: ' || rec.loan_id || ') ' ||
                     'is due in ' || v_days_until_due || ' day(s) on ' || 
                     TO_CHAR(rec.due_date, 'DD-MON-YYYY') || '. ' ||
                     'Amount due: $' || TO_CHAR(rec.monthly_payment, '999,999.99') || '. ' ||
                     'Please ensure timely payment to avoid late fees.';
```
- Personalized messages with customer names
- Includes loan-specific details
- Professional tone for customer communication

### 4. Risk Assessment and Analytics
```sql
v_risk_percentage := ROUND((v_urgent_reminders / v_total_reminders) * 100, 2);
v_avg_amount_due := ROUND(v_total_amount_due / v_total_reminders, 2);

IF v_risk_percentage >= 50 THEN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('RISK LEVEL: HIGH - Majority of loans are urgently due');
```
- Calculates risk metrics
- Provides automated risk level assessment
- Supports management decision-making
