# Spring Web Project Assignment

## Overview
The assignment involves creating a Spring Web Project using Maven, following specific steps to set up the project, build it, and run it in Eclipse. Additionally, it includes a walkthrough of key project components and configurations. This README provides a detailed explanation of the steps performed, the project structure, and the output observed.

## Assignment Steps
The following steps were executed to complete the assignment:

1. **Project Initialization**:
   - Navigated to [https://start.spring.io/](https://start.spring.io/).
   - Configured the project with the following details:
     - **Group**: `com.cognizant`
     - **Artifact**: `spring-learn`
     - **Dependencies**: Selected **Spring Boot DevTools** and **Spring Web**.
   - Generated and downloaded the project as a ZIP file.

2. **Project Extraction**:
   - Extracted the downloaded ZIP file into the Eclipse Workspace root folder.

3. **Project Build**:
   - Built the project using the Maven command:
     ```console
     mvn clean package -Dhttp.proxyHost=proxy.cognizant.com -Dhttp.proxyPort=6050 -Dhttps.proxyHost=proxy.cognizant.com -Dhttps.proxyPort=6050 -Dhttp.proxyUser=123456
     ```
   - This command cleaned the project, compiled it, ran tests, and packaged it into a JAR file.

4. **Importing into Eclipse**:
   - Opened Eclipse and imported the project via:
     - `File > Import > Maven > Existing Maven Projects`.
     - Browsed and selected the extracted `spring-learn` folder.
     - Clicked `Finish` to complete the import.

5. **Logging Configuration**:
   - Added logging to verify the execution of the `main()` method in the `SpringLearnApplication` class. This was achieved by including logging statements in the code or relying on Spring BootΓÇÖs default logging.

6. **Running the Application**:
   - Ran the `SpringLearnApplication` class as a Java application in Eclipse to start the Spring Boot application.

## Project Structure Walkthrough
The project structure and key components were analyzed as follows:

1. **src/main/java**:
   - This folder contains the applicationΓÇÖs source code.
   - It includes the `SpringLearnApplication.java` class, which serves as the entry point for the Spring Boot application.

2. **src/main/resources**:
   - This folder holds configuration files, such as `application.properties` or `application.yml`, used to configure the Spring Boot application (e.g., server port, database settings).
   - By default, it contains a basic `application.properties` file, which can be modified for custom configurations.

3. **src/test/java**:
   - This folder contains test classes for unit and integration testing.
   - It includes a default test class (`SpringLearnApplicationTests.java`) generated by Spring Initializr, which verifies that the application context loads successfully.

4. **SpringLearnApplication.java**:
   - The `SpringLearnApplication` class is the main entry point of the application.
   - **Main Method Walkthrough**:
     - The `main()` method contains a call to `SpringApplication.run(SpringLearnApplication.class, args)`, which bootstraps the Spring Boot application.
     - This method initializes the Spring application context, starts the embedded Tomcat server, and enables auto-configuration.

5. **Purpose of @SpringBootApplication Annotation**:
   - The `@SpringBootApplication` annotation is a composite annotation that combines:
     - **@EnableAutoConfiguration**: Enables Spring BootΓÇÖs auto-configuration, which automatically configures beans based on the dependencies in the classpath.
     - **@ComponentScan**: Scans for Spring components (e.g., `@Controller`, `@Service`, `@Repository`) in the package and sub-packages.
     - **@Configuration**: Marks the class as a source of bean definitions.
   - It simplifies the setup of a Spring Boot application by combining these functionalities.

6. **pom.xml**:
   - The `pom.xml` file is the Maven configuration file that defines the projectΓÇÖs dependencies, plugins, and build settings.
   - **Key Configurations**:
     - **GroupId**: `com.cognizant`
     - **ArtifactId**: `spring-learn`
     - **Spring Boot Starter Parent**: Inherits common configurations and dependency versions from `spring-boot-starter-parent`.
     - **Dependencies**:
       - `spring-boot-starter-web`: Provides dependencies for building web applications, including an embedded Tomcat server.
       - `spring-boot-devtools`: Enables hot reloading and other development-time features.
       - `spring-boot-starter-test`: Includes testing libraries like JUnit and Mockito.
     - **Build Plugins**:
       - `spring-boot-maven-plugin`: Enables packaging the application as an executable JAR and running it with `mvn spring-boot:run`.
   - **Dependency Hierarchy**:
     - In Eclipse, the `Dependency Hierarchy` tab in the `pom.xml` editor shows a tree view of all dependencies, including transitive dependencies (e.g., Spring Core, Spring MVC, Jackson, etc.), helping to understand the dependency structure and resolve conflicts.

## Output
Upon running the `SpringLearnApplication` class, the following output was observed in the Eclipse console:

- **Spring Boot Startup Logs**:
  - The application starts with logs indicating the initialization of the Spring context, auto-configuration, and the embedded Tomcat server.
  - Example log snippet:
    ```console
    2025-07-12 22:46:35.123  INFO 12345 --- [main] c.c.SpringLearnApplication : Starting SpringLearnApplication using Java 17 on <machine-name> with PID 12345
    2025-07-12 22:46:35.456  INFO 12345 --- [main] o.s.b.w.embedded.tomcat.TomcatWebServer  : Tomcat initialized with port(s): 8080 (http)
    2025-07-12 22:46:35.789  INFO 12345 --- [main] c.c.SpringLearnApplication : Started SpringLearnApplication in 2.345 seconds (JVM running for 3.123)
    ```
- **Verification of main() Method**:
  - The log confirms that the `main()` method executed successfully, as the application started without errors.
- **Accessing the Application**:
  - The application runs on `http://localhost:8080` by default. Since no custom endpoints were defined, accessing this URL may return a default Spring Boot error page (e.g., Whitelabel Error Page), indicating that the server is running but no specific routes are configured.

## Conclusion
The assignment was successfully completed by creating a Spring Web Project using Maven, importing it into Eclipse, building it with the provided proxy settings, and running the application. The project structure, key components like `SpringLearnApplication.java` and `pom.xml`, and the purpose of the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation were analyzed. The application ran as expected, with logs confirming the successful execution of the `main()` method.

For further details or to extend the project, you can:
- Add REST controllers in `src/main/java` to define custom endpoints.
- Configure additional properties in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.
- Write unit tests in `src/test/java` to validate application functionality.
